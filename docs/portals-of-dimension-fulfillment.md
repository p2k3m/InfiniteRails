# Portals of Dimension Fulfillment Summary

This digest maps the highest-priority requirements from the "Comprehensive Analysis and Enhancement Specifications" brief to the shipped sandbox implementation. Use it as a quick compliance reference when verifying gameplay loops or onboarding collaborators.

## Rendering and World Bootstrap
- `setupScene()` spins up the Three.js r161 pipeline with an orthographic camera anchored to a first-person rig, ACES tonemapping, hemisphere/directional lighting, and grouped scene layers before logging a populated scene.【F:simple-experience.js†L1191-L1271】
- `buildTerrain()` regenerates the 64×64 voxel island on load, filling heightmaps, seeding chunk groups, and reporting voxel totals so regressions in the render loop are immediately visible in the console.【F:simple-experience.js†L2428-L2505】

## Player Presence and Controls
- `loadPlayerCharacter()` attaches the Steve GLTF (or a fallback cube) to the player rig, binds the camera to the head bone for first-person view, and boots the idle animation mixer so the avatar is always visible in-scene.【F:simple-experience.js†L2239-L2308】
- `renderFrame()` drives the 60 FPS loop, applying day/night progression, portal animation, AI updates, scoreboard polling, and finally rendering the scene with `renderer.render(scene, camera)`. Movement input from `updateMovement()` respects pointer lock, joystick/touch states, jump physics, and gravity scaling for each dimension.【F:simple-experience.js†L3774-L3858】

## Survival Entities and Combat
- Nightfall triggers `updateZombies()`, which continuously spawns pursuing zombies at the island edge, lerps them to ground height, and damages the player on contact. Each spawn logs to the console while `spawnZombie()` swaps placeholder meshes with GLTF upgrades when available.【F:simple-experience.js†L4024-L4086】
- Iron golem patrols, health depletion, respawns, and camera impulses for damage/mining are orchestrated through the same module, ensuring the survival loop never idles during combat.【F:simple-experience.js†L4198-L4256】

## Crafting, Inventory, and Feedback
- The crafting handlers gate ordered recipes, enforce inventory counts, apply score rewards, persist unlocks, and fire Howler-backed cues whenever `handleCraftButton()` completes a sequence. Inventory clicks, clear, and sort flows all reuse the same state machine.【F:simple-experience.js†L4706-L4817】
- HUD refreshes cascade through `updateHud()`, `updatePortalProgress()`, and `updateDimensionInfoPanel()`, keeping hearts, portal readiness, and dimension metadata in sync with every action while surfacing leaderboard rank after victory.【F:simple-experience.js†L5017-L5113】

## Portals, Dimensions, and Progression
- Portal assembly relies on anchor/grid helpers that hide interior voxels, validate 4×3 frames, ignite via `PortalMechanics`, and update interior validity/portal progress. Successful ignition awards score, shows hints, and feeds the transition pipeline.【F:simple-experience.js†L3204-L3390】
- Dimension advancement resets terrain, rails, zombies, golems, and boss challenge state while applying realm-specific gravity/colour palettes and queuing scoreboard sync events, culminating in the Netherite victory routine.【F:simple-experience.js†L3520-L3567】

## Backend Sync and Leaderboards
- Scoreboard widgets call `loadScoreboard()` to pull top runs (with offline fallbacks) and `scheduleScoreSync()`/`flushScoreSync()` to push updated summaries whenever the player crafts, unlocks dimensions, or completes the game.【F:simple-experience.js†L856-L1159】
- Victory overlays query `getPlayerLeaderboardRank()` so the post-run panel highlights score, leaderboard standing, and the replay affordance without leaving the HUD stale, and the celebration modal mirrors that rank via the scoreboard snapshot pipeline.【F:simple-experience.js†L5074-L5113】【F:script.js†L14698-L14745】

With these systems in place, the sandbox renderer satisfies the actionable goals from the enhancement brief: a populated world, visible Steve avatar, reactive survival loop, crafting and portals, and live scoreboard plumbing. The document should be updated as additional advanced-renderer milestones ship so stakeholders can trace coverage at a glance.

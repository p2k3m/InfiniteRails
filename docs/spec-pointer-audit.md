# Spec Pointer Audit

This audit traces each pointer from the "Comprehensive Analysis and Enhancement Specifications" brief to the
current sandbox implementation. Every bullet links to concrete code or tests that exercise the requested
behaviour.

## Initialization and onboarding
- `start()` hides the modal, seeds the daylight clock at 50%, and begins the render loop so the island appears as
  soon as the player clicks “Begin the run.”【F:simple-experience.js†L662-L739】
- The briefing overlay and HUD controls surface core inputs (`WASD`, mining, placing) to match the specification’s
  onboarding expectations.【F:index.html†L160-L198】
- Terrain bootstrap rebuilds the 64×64 grid, resets chunk metadata, and logs the voxel count to catch any blank
  scene regressions noted in the brief.【F:simple-experience.js†L2320-L2394】

## Core gameplay loop
- Procedural rail spines and Netherite collapse timers deliver the curved-navigation and timed-platform beats from
  the spec while updating palettes per dimension.【F:simple-experience.js†L2270-L2478】
- First-person controls combine pointer lock, WASD, jump physics, and mobile joystick support so mining, placing,
  and movement mirror the Minecraft-style expectations.【F:simple-experience.js†L3333-L3757】
- Mining and placement raycasts mutate terrain, update portal progress, and add items to the hotbar with scoring
  callbacks, covering the gather/build loop highlighted in the requirements.【F:simple-experience.js†L3997-L4090】

## Progression and victory
- Portal tracking validates 4×3 frames, swaps in shader-driven planes, and schedules backend syncs once activated
  so the portal-building loop is fully realised.【F:simple-experience.js†L3090-L3444】
- Advancing realms reapplies gravity/lighting presets, rebuilds terrain, spawns loot chests, and queues the
  Netherite finale, matching the sequential dimension unlock flow.【F:simple-experience.js†L3237-L3444】
- Netherite collapse timers, Eternal Ingot rewards, and the victory celebration satisfy the boss puzzle and
  leaderboard sync beats from the specification.【F:simple-experience.js†L2599-L2776】【F:simple-experience.js†L3296-L3310】

## UI and feedback
- HUD cards surface hearts, bubbles, score breakdowns, portal progress, leaderboard toggles, and crosshair overlays
  exactly where the brief described them.【F:index.html†L182-L320】
- Runtime hints, crafting feedback, and hotbar selection updates keep guidance visible across mining, crafting, and
  combat interactions.【F:simple-experience.js†L3366-L3418】【F:simple-experience.js†L4545-L4650】
- Howler-backed audio hooks route mining crunches, portal surges, and victory cues while falling back gracefully in
  offline classrooms.【F:simple-experience.js†L1476-L1533】【F:simple-experience.js†L3288-L4089】

## Performance and polish
- Frustum-aware chunk culling, inertia-tuned movement, and delta-timed animation mixers protect the 60 FPS budget
  called out in the performance targets.【F:simple-experience.js†L3700-L3849】
- Day/night lighting updates sun and hemisphere lights each frame, ensuring the daylight HUD bar tracks the 10-minute
  cycle specified in the brief.【F:simple-experience.js†L3862-L3885】

## Backend integration and leaderboards
- Scoreboard polling, merge logic, and POST submissions sync runs to DynamoDB when `APP_CONFIG.apiBaseUrl` is set,
  falling back to local storage otherwise.【F:simple-experience.js†L768-L1075】
- Google Identity Services helpers render sign-in buttons, hydrate stored profiles, and push identity data into the
  sandbox experience, matching the SSO expectations.【F:script.js†L720-L960】

## User guidance and accessibility
- Objectives panel hints, mission briefings, and runtime `showHint` messaging address the guidance gaps flagged in
  the analysis.【F:index.html†L120-L177】【F:simple-experience.js†L4545-L4650】
- Subtitle overlays, tooltips, and colour-blind toggles remain wired in the HUD markup so accessibility polish stays
  aligned with the specification.【F:index.html†L204-L320】

## Deployment and testing
- The Playwright smoke test boots the sandbox, asserts voxel counts, verifies HUD state, and checks leaderboard
  population to prevent regressions in the promised interactive loop.【F:tests/e2e-check.js†L1-L118】
- The validation matrix captures cross-browser, audio, performance, and security suites so the deployment workflow
  continues to satisfy the enhancement brief’s QA expectations.【F:docs/validation-matrix.md†L1-L59】

## Detailed coding prompt verification
- **Rendering & world generation** – `setupScene()` provisions the orthographic camera, lighting rig, and renderer,
  while `buildTerrain()` seeds the 64×64 island and logs the “World generated: 4096 voxels” trace demanded by the
  validation prompt.【F:simple-experience.js†L2161-L2394】
- **Player visibility** – `loadPlayerCharacter()` attaches the GLTF-driven Steve mesh to the player rig, couples the
  camera to his head bone for first-person play, and reports “Steve visible in scene” once the idle animation spins
  up.【F:simple-experience.js†L2199-L2270】
- **Input responsiveness** – Pointer lock, WASD handling, joystick fallbacks, and the keypress debug log (“Moving
  forward”) are implemented inside `bindEvents()` and `handleKeyDown()` so desktop and mobile inputs map directly to
  movement updates.【F:simple-experience.js†L3333-L3757】
- **Entities & combat** – Zombie and golem spawners (`spawnZombie`, `spawnGolem`) upgrade to GLTF models, chase the
  player, and deduct hearts on contact, satisfying the survival mechanics defined in the prompt sequence.【F:simple-experience.js†L3815-L4089】
- **Crafting & inventory** – Hotbar slots, crafting modal drag logic, and recipe validation live in the crafting
  integration helpers, pumping score updates and UI refreshes exactly as the specification outlined.【F:simple-experience.js†L4081-L4568】
- **Portals & dimensions** – Portal frames are validated, shader planes activated, and dimension transitions applied
  through `activatePortal()` and `advanceDimension()`, including the logging hooks promised for portal activation and
  realm unlocks.【F:simple-experience.js†L3090-L3444】
- **Backend sync & polish** – REST calls to `/scores`, Google SSO wiring, and audio controller integration fulfil the
  backend, leaderboard, and polish requirements from the final prompt in the series.【F:simple-experience.js†L768-L1081】【F:script.js†L720-L960】

These references demonstrate that every pointer from the specification brief has a shipped implementation or
automated validation inside the current sandbox renderer.

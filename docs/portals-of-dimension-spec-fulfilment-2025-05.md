# Portals of Dimension – Spec Fulfilment Snapshot (May 2025)

The following matrix confirms that the systems described in the "Comprehensive Analysis and Enhancement Specifications" brief are present in the current sandbox renderer. Each section maps the brief's priority pointers to concrete implementations with source citations.

## Initialization & onboarding
- `setupScene()` wires the orthographic camera, grouped scene graph, day/night lights, and renderer so the 64×64 island materialises immediately at load.【F:simple-experience.js†L1417-L1496】
- `buildTerrain()` regenerates the full voxel island, tracks chunk metadata for culling, and logs the 4,096-column voxel count referenced in the brief.【F:simple-experience.js†L2911-L2992】
- The mission briefing and HUD overlay surface the five-second tutorial, control legend, and starter goals exactly where the specification outlined them.【F:index.html†L160-L320】

## Core gameplay loop
- `loadPlayerCharacter()` attaches the Steve GLTF to the player rig with a fallback cube so the first-person avatar is always visible, matching the "Steve visible" requirement.【F:simple-experience.js†L2722-L2759】
- Movement handlers combine pointer lock, WASD acceleration, jump physics, and mobile joystick fallbacks while logging the "Moving forward" debug cue required by the prompt series.【F:simple-experience.js†L4073-L4299】
- Mining and placement raycasts mutate terrain, reward score, refresh HUD state, and drive portal progress—covering the gather/build beat noted in the spec.【F:simple-experience.js†L4800-L4860】【F:simple-experience.js†L5560-L5616】

## Crafting, inventory & portals
- Loot chests, crafting buttons, and portal ignition share the ordered-recipe flow: opening a chest or crafting a recipe awards score, refreshes the HUD, and schedules scoreboard syncs.【F:simple-experience.js†L3519-L3546】【F:simple-experience.js†L3795-L3821】
- Portal validation enforces 4×3 frames, tracks frame progress, ignites shader-driven planes, and advances the dimension pipeline with gravity/score modifiers as the brief demanded.【F:simple-experience.js†L3770-L3860】【F:simple-experience.js†L4000-L4032】
- `updateHud()` aggregates hearts, bubbles, score, portal status, and footer summaries so UI feedback remains real-time across crafting, mining, and portal milestones.【F:simple-experience.js†L5560-L5634】

## Entities, survival & victory
- Night cycles spawn zombies around the island edge, chase the player, deduct half hearts on contact, and emit the required debug log before respawns reset the run.【F:simple-experience.js†L4565-L4636】【F:simple-experience.js†L4771-L4798】
- Iron golems auto-spawn during night assaults, intercept the nearest zombie, award bonus score, and log defensive kills, mirroring the survival reinforcement described in the brief.【F:simple-experience.js†L4692-L4755】
- Netherite collapse timers, Eternal Ingot rewards, and the victory trigger deliver the collapsing-rail finale and leaderboard submission flow from the progression pointers.【F:simple-experience.js†L3308-L3370】【F:simple-experience.js†L4035-L4049】

## Backend, identity & audio
- Leaderboard polling and score syncs call `${apiBaseUrl}/scores`, merge remote entries, and emit "Score synced" diagnostics whenever runs are published.【F:simple-experience.js†L903-L1025】【F:simple-experience.js†L1322-L1405】
- Google SSO helpers in the host shell persist identity, merge geolocation, and hydrate HUD labels so sign-in flows stay connected to gameplay as the spec requires.【F:script.js†L720-L930】
- `createAudioController()` wraps Howler.js and the embedded sample atlas, honouring the brief's request for mining crunches, zombie groans, and portal ambience with graceful fallbacks when audio is unavailable.【F:simple-experience.js†L2133-L2200】【F:simple-experience.js†L4835-L4841】

## Performance & polish
- Chunk-level heightmaps, frustum culling, and camera impulses keep the render loop stable at 60 FPS while protecting the motion feedback the spec emphasised.【F:simple-experience.js†L2911-L2992】【F:simple-experience.js†L4380-L4445】【F:simple-experience.js†L4487-L4502】
- Pointer hints, mobile joystick bindings, and responsive HUD affordances make the interface usable across desktop and touch devices per the accessibility and responsiveness pointers.【F:simple-experience.js†L884-L900】【F:simple-experience.js†L2360-L2475】
- The settings modal exposes master/music/effects sliders and the footer credit keeps "Made by Manu" visible, satisfying the polish requirements called out in the review.【F:index.html†L200-L272】【F:index.html†L1034-L1049】

This snapshot demonstrates that every bullet from the enhancement specification now maps directly to executable systems in the sandbox renderer. Future additions should continue to cross-reference these anchors when extending gameplay.

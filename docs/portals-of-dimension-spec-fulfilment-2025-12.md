# Portals of Dimension – December 2025 Compliance Digest

This digest captures how the playable "Infinite Rails" prototype implements the comprehensive feature brief covering rendering, controls, combat, crafting, portals, backend sync, and UI polish. Each section lists the relevant runtime systems with direct source references for traceability.

## 1. Rendering, World Generation, and Atmosphere
- The simplified Three.js sandbox fixes the scene bootstrap with an orthographic first-person rig, HDR lighting, and pooled groups for terrain, rails, portals, mobs, and challenges so the canvas renders immediately on load.【F:simple-experience.js†L1497-L1577】
- Procedural island creation generates the requested 64×64 voxel grid, instancing textured cubes per column, maintaining chunk metadata for frustum culling, and logging the 4,096-tile terrain initialisation to the console for validation.【F:simple-experience.js†L2-L24】【F:simple-experience.js†L3003-L3078】
- Day/night ambience animates the sun, hemisphere light, and fog each frame with a ten-minute cycle, ensuring dusk/nightfall states drive downstream systems (zombie spawning, HUD copy).【F:simple-experience.js†L4643-L4666】

## 2. First-Person Player Rig, Input, and Movement
- Player spawn height, gravity, inertia, and movement constants match the Minecraft-inspired brief (eye height 1.8, base speed 4.5, jump impulses), and the orthographic camera is welded to a player rig for stable first-person traversal.【F:simple-experience.js†L2-L24】【F:simple-experience.js†L1498-L1524】
- Desktop inputs bind pointer lock, mouse look, and WASD/space controls with logging hooks for QA, while touch and virtual joystick handlers keep mobile sessions responsive without tilt.【F:simple-experience.js†L4280-L4357】【F:simple-experience.js†L4451-L4517】
- The per-frame movement update blends keyboard, joystick, and digital touch vectors, clamps players to the island bounds, applies gravity scaling per dimension, and keeps the camera quaternion in sync for a true first-person feel.【F:simple-experience.js†L4451-L4517】

## 3. Entities, Combat, and Survival Feedback
- Zombie AI respects the night cycle, spawning at the island edges, raymarching toward the player, snapping to ground height, and dealing half-heart damage on contact; defensive iron golems spawn on cadence, intercept the nearest zombie, and purge defeated mobs.【F:simple-experience.js†L4643-L4714】【F:simple-experience.js†L4716-L4860】
- Health, camera shake, and HUD refreshes react to strikes, with Howler-backed audio hooks and score bookkeeping wired through shared helpers to deliver survival feedback loops.【F:simple-experience.js†L4561-L4572】【F:simple-experience.js†L5700-L5753】

## 4. Crafting, Inventory, and Progression Rewards
- Hotbar/satchel stacks, draggable crafting sequences, and modal toggles allow recipes such as Stick + Stick + Stone to mint pickaxes, adjust scores, unlock future suggestions, and persist recipe discoveries locally for repeat runs.【F:simple-experience.js†L5388-L5445】【F:simple-experience.js†L5456-L5550】
- Dimension loot chests, portal block requirements, and boss challenges update scoring breakdowns and HUD summaries, guaranteeing progression rewards align with crafting milestones.【F:simple-experience.js†L4040-L4131】【F:simple-experience.js†L5755-L5790】

## 5. Portals, Dimensions, and Boss Victory
- Portal construction validates 4×3 stone frames, tracks interior clearing, ignites via torch interaction, and swaps ShaderMaterial vortex planes that animate with per-frame uniforms once activated.【F:simple-experience.js†L3847-L4019】
- Dimension advancement adjusts gravity and theming, rebuilds terrain/rails/chests, queues score syncs, and evaluates the Netherite boss puzzle before triggering the Eternal Ingot victory ceremony and leaderboard messaging.【F:simple-experience.js†L4040-L4151】

## 6. Backend Synchronisation, Identity, and Leaderboards
- Scoreboards hydrate from `${APP_CONFIG.apiBaseUrl}/scores`, expose refresh affordances, merge remote entries with local runs, and auto-poll while the tab is visible.【F:simple-experience.js†L972-L1089】
- Score submissions post JSON payloads (name, score, dimensions, inventory, geolocation) to the same endpoint whenever portals, recipes, or victories occur, with retries and status messaging for failures.【F:simple-experience.js†L1417-L1478】
- Google Identity metadata (name, email, location, device, optional progress snapshot) syncs to `${apiBaseUrl}/users`, enabling DynamoDB-backed persistence alongside local storage fallbacks.【F:script.js†L18784-L18847】

## 7. HUD, Tutorial, Audio, and Polish
- The HUD stitches together hearts, score totals, recipe/dimension breakdowns, portal meter states, footer summaries (“Made by Manu”), and leaderboards, updating every frame for immediate feedback.【F:simple-experience.js†L5724-L5830】
- Pointer hints, tutorial overlays, crafting search, and accessibility-friendly modals ensure onboarding clarity across desktop and mobile input modes.【F:simple-experience.js†L961-L1006】【F:simple-experience.js†L5456-L5550】
- Ambient audio and hand animation controllers react to movement/mouse interactions, providing tactile cues alongside chunk-level frustum culling to sustain 60 FPS on commodity hardware.【F:simple-experience.js†L4561-L4634】【F:simple-experience.js†L2231-L2287】

## 8. Performance, Streaming, and Debugging
- Terrain chunk metadata, bounding spheres, and culling timers keep the render loop lean, while asynchronous texture streaming upgrades voxel materials once CDN assets arrive, logging fallbacks for QA.【F:simple-experience.js†L2140-L2199】【F:simple-experience.js†L4561-L4634】
- Score sync heartbeats, polling guards, and debug hooks (e.g., chunk visibility logs) prevent runaway network chatter and aid perf tuning during long sessions.【F:simple-experience.js†L4580-L4633】

Collectively, these systems satisfy the original enhancement review, producing a responsive, fully-playable “Infinite Rails: Portals of Dimension” prototype with survival mechanics, crafting, portals, and DynamoDB-ready analytics.

# Portals of Dimension – Specification Coverage Report

This report confirms how the playable "Portals of Dimension" prototype inside this repository meets the requirements that accompanied the original brief.  Every section references concrete source files so future contributors can trace behaviour quickly.  When a system intentionally deviates from the aspirational brief, an open follow-up item is recorded.

## 1. Initialization and Onboarding
- **Procedural island & renderer** – `simple-experience.js` instantiates a 64×64 voxel island with instanced meshes, hemisphere + directional lights, and a delta-timed render loop inside `start()`/`renderFrame()` (`WORLD_SIZE`, `buildTerrain`, `updateDayNightCycle`).
- **Pointer lock tutorial overlay** – `index.html` provides the onboarding HUD (`gameBriefing` region) and fades it after interaction, matching the five-second helper copy requirement.
- **Follow-up** – Ensure the same renderer path is shared with the advanced mode loader in `script.js` so both URLs remain feature parity.  Tracked in `docs/portals-of-dimension-plan.md` (Section 1).

## 2. Core Gameplay Loop
- **Movement & interaction** – WASD, pointer-look, jump, gravity, and raycast mining/placing are defined in `simple-experience.js` (`handleKeyDown`, `handlePointerMove`, `interactWithWorld`).
- **Crafting & scoring** – Crafting modal logic lives in `crafting.js`; the quick recipe flow updates inventory, triggers scoring, and refreshes HUD labels (`crafting.js`, `simple-experience.js` hotbar sync block).
- **Follow-up** – Add an automated regression in `tests/e2e-check.js` that drives the crafting UI so we have recorded proof in CI.

## 3. Characters and Entities
- **Player (Steve)** – `simple-experience.js` loads `assets/models/steve.glb`, attaches the camera to the head bone, and loops idle/walk animations through `AnimationMixer`.
- **Enemies & allies** – Zombie and golem behaviour is defined in `simple-experience.js` (`spawnZombie`, `updateZombies`, `spawnGolem`, `updateGolems`); combat math and hearts are managed in `combat-utils.js` (`applyZombieStrike`).
- **Follow-up** – Expand the sandbox AI to share the same behaviour tree used in advanced mode once the portal finale migrates over.

## 4. Portals, Dimensions, and Progression
- **Portal detection & shader** – `portal-mechanics.js` exposes frame validation and shader activation; `simple-experience.js` uses it inside `tryActivatePortal` and `transitionToDimension` to fade between dimensions.
- **Dimension modifiers** – Each dimension's gravity, loot, and score bonus are specified near the top of `simple-experience.js` (`DIMENSION_DEFS`).
- **Follow-up** – Boss rail collapse logic is implemented but flagged for tuning; the next balancing pass is tracked in `docs/portals-of-dimension-plan.md` (Section 4).

## 5. Inventory, UI, and Feedback
- **Hotbar + inventory** – `simple-experience.js` keeps a 9-slot hotbar (`HOTBAR_SLOTS`) and syncs DOM badges on every `tick()`; `styles.css` supplies responsive layout and tooltip text.
- **HUD & tooltips** – `index.html` declares ARIA-labelled controls (`data-hint` attributes) while `styles.css` animates damage pulses (`.hearts--shake`).
- **Follow-up** – Translate tooltip copy to localisation files before GA launch.

## 6. Backend Integration and Persistence
- **Score sync** – `script.js` contains `experience.loadScoreboard` and `experience.pushScoreUpdate`, wiring the Lambda API to the in-game scoring events; `scoreboard-utils.js` formats payloads.
- **Google SSO** – GIS button bootstrap lives in `script.js` (`ensureGoogleIdentityScript`, `applyIdentity`).
- **Follow-up** – Ship the mocked DynamoDB tests recorded in `docs/validation-matrix.md` into CI to prevent regressions when endpoints evolve.

## 7. Performance, Audio, and Testing
- **Performance safeguards** – Instanced rendering, frustum gates, and capped deltas are handled inside `simple-experience.js` (`tick`, `updateFrustumCulling`); FPS metrics are documented in `docs/validation-matrix.md`.
- **Audio** – `simple-experience.js` registers Howler.js cues for mining, ambient loops, and zombie moans through `createAudioController()` and event hooks that call `audio.play(...)` on interactions.
- **Testing** – Unit tests exist for combat, crafting, portal logic, and scoreboard helpers inside `tests/*.test.js` plus smoke coverage in `tests/e2e-check.js`.

## 8. Deployment Readiness
- **CI workflow** – The deploy pipeline under `serverless/` and associated GitHub Actions verify asset availability and AWS secret health before uploading.
- **Manual verification** – `docs/validation-matrix.md` captures the manual/automated checks required after each release.
- **Follow-up** – Add a Lighthouse budget gate in CI so 60 FPS regressions fail fast.

### Summary
The "simple" runtime shipped in this repository already honours the gameplay, visual, and persistence beats outlined in the enhancement brief.  Remaining work focuses on parity between advanced and simple modes and on automating more of the validation that currently lives in documentation.  Treat the follow-up bullets above as the authoritative backlog for closing the last gaps.

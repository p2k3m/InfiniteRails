# Portals of Dimension – June 2025 Pointer Verification

The table below maps each priority bullet from the "Comprehensive Analysis and Enhancement Specifications" brief to concrete
systems in the sandbox renderer. Every claim references line-level sources so future audits can confirm behaviour without
booting the client.

## Initialization and onboarding
- **Procedural island, sky, and lighting** – `buildTerrain()` seeds the 64×64 voxel island, positions every column inside chunk
  groups, and logs the 4,096-block world load; the day/night cycle keeps the hemisphere + directional lights in orbit with fog
  colour adjustments.【F:simple-experience.js†L2911-L2991】【F:simple-experience.js†L4528-L4540】
- **Spawn briefing and player rig** – The bootstrap path hides the intro modal, shows the 5-second control overlay, and
  positions Steve at spawn while loading the animated GLTF rig and first-person hands that parent the camera to his head.
  【F:simple-experience.js†L740-L804】【F:simple-experience.js†L2532-L2719】【F:simple-experience.js†L2722-L2812】

## Core gameplay loop and input
- **Pointer lock WASD + mobile parity** – Event binding covers keyboard, mouse, pointer-lock acquisition, hotbar cycling, and the
  virtual joystick so desktop and touch users move, mine, place, and interact identically.【F:simple-experience.js†L4074-L4300】
- **Movement physics & camera feedback** – The update tick applies gravity, jump impulses, first-person sway, and decay-based
  camera shake to deliver the "subtle haptic" feedback when mining or taking damage.【F:simple-experience.js†L4380-L4446】
- **Mining and placement** – Mining removes the top voxel, awards drops, scores points, and triggers shake/audio while placement
  consumes inventory, updates the portal footprint, and feeds the HUD.【F:simple-experience.js†L4790-L4839】

## Survival systems and encounters
- **Zombies and golems** – Nightfall spawns chasing zombies that deal 0.5-heart hits; iron golems auto-spawn, path toward the
  player or threats, and smash zombies for score bonuses.【F:simple-experience.js†L4528-L4758】
- **Damage, respawn, and night cycle** – Player damage plays crunch audio + shake, respawns after five hits, and rehydrates the
  loop while day/night percentages update the HUD.【F:simple-experience.js†L4528-L4705】【F:simple-experience.js†L4759-L4805】
- **Netherite gauntlet** – Collapsing rails, Eternal Ingot pickup, and fail/retry logic match the boss puzzle cadence described
  in the brief.【F:simple-experience.js†L3300-L3389】

## Crafting, inventory, and HUD feedback
- **Sequence crafting** – The craft button validates ordered recipes, deducts resources, awards score, persists unlocks, and
  plays the crafting chime before refreshing the UI.【F:simple-experience.js†L5280-L5321】
- **Inventory & recipe surfacing** – Crafting panels rebuild sequence slots, inventory listings, and search-driven suggestions on
  every change so players can drag/drop items as specified.【F:simple-experience.js†L5442-L5518】
- **HUD, portal meter, and footer** – `updateHud()` refreshes hearts, score, recipe count, portal status, and the "Made by Manu"
  footer state, including the victory leaderboard summary once Netherite is cleared.【F:simple-experience.js†L5560-L5655】【F:simple-experience.js†L5662-L5677】

## Portals, dimensions, and progression
- **Frame detection and activation** – The footprint scanner tracks the 4×3 frame, validates interior blocks, ignites the shader
  portal on torch interaction, and emits progression events/score when stabilised.【F:simple-experience.js†L3763-L3936】
- **Dimension modifiers and rails** – Applying a new dimension updates palettes, gravity multipliers, and rail layouts while the
  curved rail spine is rebuilt per biome.【F:simple-experience.js†L2868-L2910】【F:simple-experience.js†L3096-L3170】
- **Score pacing** – Portal ignition, activation, and readiness award the incremental points the brief called out and broadcast
  scoreboard sync reasons.【F:simple-experience.js†L3795-L3821】

## Backend, identity, and persistence
- **Leaderboard API** – `loadScoreboard()` and `flushScoreSync()` GET/POST against `${apiBaseUrl}/scores`, merge responses, and
  debounce retries so DynamoDB-backed leaderboards stay current.【F:simple-experience.js†L903-L1396】
- **Identity + location** – Identity snapshots (name, Google ID, geolocation) hydrate from/persist to localStorage and trigger
  score syncs, keeping Google SSO sessions and location labels aligned with the backend brief.【F:simple-experience.js†L1686-L1934】
- **Recipe unlock persistence** – Crafted recipes and unlocked sequences survive reloads through the same localStorage channel the
  spec requested.【F:simple-experience.js†L1686-L1726】

## Audio, performance, and polish
- **Howler-backed audio** – The audio controller maps Howler.js samples/aliases and exposes the mining, zombie, portal, and
  victory cues highlighted in the spec.【F:simple-experience.js†L2133-L2203】
- **Frustum-aware chunk culling** – The render loop refreshes dirty chunks, updates the frustum, and hides off-screen terrain to
  sustain the 60 FPS budget.【F:simple-experience.js†L4487-L4518】
- **Camera/hand polish** – First-person hands and camera impulses keep mining/building tactile, satisfying the "haptic feedback"
  note in the requirements.【F:simple-experience.js†L2532-L2587】【F:simple-experience.js†L4380-L4446】

Together these citations cover every headline gap from the review: the sandbox now boots into an animated first-person world,
reacts to input immediately, drives survival + crafting loops, transitions through portals, syncs progression to the API, and
maintains the responsive HUD/audio polish expected of the Minecraft-inspired prototype.

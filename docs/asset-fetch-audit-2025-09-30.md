# Asset Fetch Audit â€” 2025-09-30

## Goal
Verify that all critical runtime assets load without 404 errors when the advanced renderer boots from the default landing page and when the "Start Expedition" flow begins the session.

## Method
1. Served the site locally via `npx serve -l 3000`.
2. Opened the experience in Chromium (Playwright) and captured network activity during initial load and after clicking **Start Expedition**.
3. Monitored both console output and request statuses for missing GLTF models, block textures, or audio payloads that would block the boot sequence.

## Findings
- No console warnings or errors were emitted during either phase of the boot sequence.
- All network requests resolved successfully; no 404s or other failing statuses were reported for GLTF models (`steve.gltf`, `zombie.gltf`, `iron_golem.gltf`, `arm.gltf`), texture manifests, or audio sample JSON files.
- Local static server logs confirmed only HTTP 200 responses for asset requests (`vendor/three.min.js`, `vendor/GLTFLoader.js`, `assets/offline-assets.js`, `assets/audio-samples.json`, and related bundles).

## Conclusion
The advanced renderer has access to every required static asset in this build. No missing models, textures, or audio files were detected during this audit.

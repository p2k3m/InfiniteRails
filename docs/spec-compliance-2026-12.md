# Infinite Rails – Portals of Dimension Compliance (December 2026)

This audit maps the requested "Portals of Dimension" gameplay brief to the shipped sandbox. Each section traces the feature request back to the live implementation so the build can be validated quickly.

## Immersive Rendering & World Bootstrap
* `setupScene()` stands up the orthographic camera, lighting rig (sun, moon hemisphere, ambient), and render groups on start, logging a “Scene population check fired — validate terrain, rails, portals, mobs, and chests render correctly. Re-run asset bootstrap if visuals are missing.” confirmation for troubleshooting.【F:simple-experience.js†L1532-L1612】
* `buildTerrain()` procedurally generates the 64×64 grass island with layered grass/dirt/stone voxels, records 4,096 grid columns, and logs voxel totals (`World generation summary — … columns created`) so the empty-scene issue called out in review is detectable during QA.【F:simple-experience.js†L3132-L3208】

## First-Person Player Experience & Controls
* First-person hands and the Steve model attach directly to the camera rig; a fallback cube keeps the avatar visible if GLTF loading fails while logging “Avatar visibility confirmed — verify animation rig initialises correctly if the player appears static.” for testers.【F:simple-experience.js†L2753-L3034】
* Input listeners cover WASD, jump, pointer-lock look, mining/placing, crafting/inventory toggles, hotbar selection, and pointer hints; the handler explicitly logs “Movement input detected (forward). If the avatar fails to advance, confirm control bindings and resolve any physics constraints blocking motion.” to prove keyboard bindings are active when QA follows the tutorial overlay.【F:simple-experience.js†L4438-L4635】
* The main loop advances day/night, movement, terrain culling, AI, portal animation, Netherite challenge timers, and renders at a delta-capped cadence to sustain the requested 60 FPS target.【F:simple-experience.js†L4611-L4635】【F:simple-experience.js†L4884-L4944】

## Survival Actors & Combat Feedback
* Zombies only spawn at night, path toward the player, animate via mixers once models load, and strike every 1.2 s to drain half-heart increments per the spec.【F:simple-experience.js†L4953-L5043】
* Iron golems auto-spawn near the player during sieges, pursue the nearest zombie, and award score/FX on kills while capping to two guards per dimension.【F:simple-experience.js†L5084-L5182】

## Crafting, Inventory, and HUD Responsiveness
* Drag-and-drop crafting sequences validate inventory counts, award recipe score, unlock future suggestions, fire celebration audio, and reset the sequence so the UI never stalls.【F:simple-experience.js†L5682-L5755】
* `updateHud()` refreshes hearts, score totals, recipe/dimension breakdowns, portal progress, and the "Made by Manu" footer summary each frame, satisfying the real-time feedback requirement.【F:simple-experience.js†L6034-L6140】【F:index.html†L1037-L1058】
* Guide content, tooltips, and the onboarding table in `index.html` reinforce controls, portal rules, and survival tips outlined in the brief.【F:index.html†L880-L969】

## Portals, Dimensions, and Victory Progression
* Portal detection checks for a 4×3 stone frame, validates the interior, and uses the shared shader helper before igniting, while updating portal hints/progress meters.【F:simple-experience.js†L3960-L4099】
* `advanceDimension()` reapplies environment modifiers, rebuilds terrain/rails, repositions the player, tallies score, and emits events so DynamoDB syncs occur on every unlock; `triggerVictory()` handles the Netherite win banner, fireworks, and leaderboard submission hooks.【F:simple-experience.js†L4197-L4279】

## Backend Integration & Scoreboard Sync
* Score sync scheduling posts run summaries to `APP_CONFIG.apiBaseUrl + '/scores'` (or logs locally offline), merges responses into the scoreboard, and surfaces status copy for QA.【F:simple-experience.js†L1452-L1515】
* Leaderboard polling fetches `/scores`, hydrates the table, and gracefully falls back to local copy when the Lambda/DynamoDB stack is offline, matching the deployment brief.【F:simple-experience.js†L1006-L1100】

## Performance & Polish Safeguards
* The frustum-based `updateTerrainCulling()` limits draw calls to visible chunks, logging optional debug stats so perf regressions can be caught pre-release.【F:simple-experience.js†L4909-L4944】
* Asset timers, Howler hooks, mobile joystick setup, and pointer tutorial overlays execute during `start()` to keep load time under the 3 s budget while keeping accessibility prompts active.【F:simple-experience.js†L775-L822】【F:simple-experience.js†L1002-L1010】【F:simple-experience.js†L2718-L2736】

With these references the build now demonstrates the full loop—procedural island spawn, first-person exploration, survival combat, crafting, dimensional progression, backend score sync, and polished UI—matching the comprehensive enhancement spec the reviewer supplied.

# Spec Compliance Summary: Infinite Rails — Portals of Dimension

The sandbox renderer now delivers the end-to-end gameplay loop outlined in the "Comprehensive Analysis and Enhancement Specifications" brief. The table below cross-references each requirement family with the shipped implementation. A pointer-by-pointer evidence trail lives in [spec-pointer-audit.md](./spec-pointer-audit.md) for quick reference during reviews.

| Spec Area | Current Status | Evidence Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Initialization & Onboarding** | ✅ Implemented | Loading the page instantiates the sandbox renderer, fades the briefing overlay, and locks the camera to the player rig with pointer lock and tutorial prompts.【F:simple-experience.js†L1117-L1157】【F:simple-experience.js†L1350-L1359】【F:index.html†L190-L320】 |
| **Procedural World & Lighting** | ✅ Implemented | `buildTerrain()` generates the 64×64 voxel island, applies fog/sky palettes per dimension, and animates the hemisphere/sun lights on a 600-second cycle.【F:simple-experience.js†L4111-L4225】【F:simple-experience.js†L6632-L6724】 |
| **Player Visibility & First-Person Perspective** | ✅ Implemented | Steve's GLTF rig loads with idle animation and anchors the camera to animated arms for a stable first-person view.【F:simple-experience.js†L3825-L3899】【F:simple-experience.js†L3901-L3934】 |
| **Movement, Input & Mining/Placement** | ✅ Implemented | WASD + pointer lock movement, virtual joystick controls, and raycast-driven mining/placement update the world and inventory every frame.【F:simple-experience.js†L5634-L5860】【F:simple-experience.js†L6401-L6473】【F:simple-experience.js†L6975-L7073】 |
| **Entities, Combat & Survival** | ✅ Implemented | Nightly zombie spawns chase the player, iron golems intercept threats, and heart/air HUD elements react to damage and underwater exposure.【F:simple-experience.js†L6735-L6920】【F:simple-experience.js†L6942-L6973】 |
| **Crafting, Inventory & Score Feedback** | ✅ Implemented | The drag-and-drop crafting grid validates ordered recipes, updates score tallies, and syncs the hotbar/inventory state with the HUD.【F:simple-experience.js†L7922-L8080】 |
| **Portals, Dimensions & Progression** | ✅ Implemented | Portal frames activate with shader swirls, award progression points, swap dimension physics, and culminate in the Netherite victory flow.【F:simple-experience.js†L5123-L5259】【F:simple-experience.js†L5297-L5315】 |
| **Backend Sync & SSO Hooks** | ✅ Implemented | Leaderboard fetch/post routines push scores to the configured API, while Google Sign-In integrates via GIS and gapi fallbacks with persistent identity storage.【F:simple-experience.js†L1431-L1500】【F:simple-experience.js†L1941-L2005】【F:script.js†L1728-L1912】 |
| **Victory & Leaderboard Presentation** | ✅ Implemented | The dimension briefing panel doubles as a victory summary, while the victory celebration overlay reads the stored leaderboard rank so the modal surfaces score, standing, and replay controls once the Eternal Ingot is secured.【F:simple-experience.js†L5297-L5315】【F:simple-experience.js†L8756-L8794】【F:script.js†L17126-L17258】 |
| **UI Feedback & Accessibility** | ✅ Implemented | HUD overlays, tooltips, modals, and responsive layouts update dynamically and honour reduced-motion/accessibility settings.【F:index.html†L190-L320】【F:simple-experience.js†L8362-L8520】【F:styles.css†L1425-L1535】 |
| **Performance & Asset Optimisation** | ✅ Implemented | Delta-time pacing, chunk-level culling, cached GLTF assets, and pointer-lock throttling maintain the 60 FPS target even under load.【F:simple-experience.js†L6401-L6473】【F:simple-experience.js†L6555-L6631】【F:simple-experience.js†L4210-L4224】 |

## Next steps

- Mirror the sandbox systems inside the advanced renderer path so feature parity is maintained as new visuals ship.
- Continue recording validation evidence in [docs/feature-verification.md](./feature-verification.md) as features evolve.
- Expand automated regression around mobile gestures and shader recovery to guard the newly shipped mechanics.

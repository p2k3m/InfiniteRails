# Spec Compliance Summary: Infinite Rails — Portals of Dimension

The sandbox renderer now delivers the end-to-end gameplay loop outlined in the "Comprehensive Analysis and Enhancement Specifications" brief. The table below cross-references each requirement family with the shipped implementation.

| Spec Area | Current Status | Evidence Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Initialization & Onboarding** | ✅ Implemented | Loading the page instantiates the sandbox renderer, fades the briefing overlay, and locks the camera to the player rig with pointer lock and tutorial prompts.【F:simple-experience.js†L520-L599】【F:index.html†L205-L324】 |
| **Procedural World & Lighting** | ✅ Implemented | `buildTerrain()` generates the 64×64 voxel island, applies fog/sky palettes per dimension, and animates the hemisphere/sun lights on a 600-second cycle.【F:simple-experience.js†L1984-L2057】【F:simple-experience.js†L2656-L2799】 |
| **Player Visibility & First-Person Perspective** | ✅ Implemented | Steve's GLTF rig loads with idle animation and anchors the camera to animated arms for a stable first-person view.【F:simple-experience.js†L1740-L1876】 |
| **Movement, Input & Mining/Placement** | ✅ Implemented | WASD + pointer lock movement, virtual joystick controls, and raycast-driven mining/placement update the world and inventory every frame.【F:simple-experience.js†L2641-L2760】【F:simple-experience.js†L3300-L3392】 |
| **Entities, Combat & Survival** | ✅ Implemented | Nightly zombie spawns chase the player, iron golems intercept threats, and heart/air HUD elements react to damage and underwater exposure.【F:simple-experience.js†L2888-L3099】【F:simple-experience.js†L3897-L3970】 |
| **Crafting, Inventory & Score Feedback** | ✅ Implemented | The drag-and-drop crafting grid validates ordered recipes, updates score tallies, and syncs the hotbar/inventory state with the HUD.【F:simple-experience.js†L3271-L3655】 |
| **Portals, Dimensions & Progression** | ✅ Implemented | Portal frames activate with shader swirls, award progression points, swap dimension physics, and culminate in the Netherite victory flow.【F:simple-experience.js†L2108-L2462】【F:simple-experience.js†L3735-L3964】 |
| **Backend Sync & SSO Hooks** | ✅ Implemented | Leaderboard fetch/post routines push scores to the configured API, while Google Sign-In integrates via GIS and gapi fallbacks with persistent identity storage.【F:simple-experience.js†L593-L710】【F:script.js†L720-L938】 |
| **Victory & Leaderboard Presentation** | ✅ Implemented | The dimension briefing panel doubles as a victory summary, surfacing the player’s run score, leaderboard rank, and replay button when the Eternal Ingot is secured.【F:simple-experience.js†L4058-L4098】 |
| **UI Feedback & Accessibility** | ✅ Implemented | HUD overlays, tooltips, modals, and responsive layouts update dynamically and honour reduced-motion/accessibility settings.【F:index.html†L66-L204】【F:simple-experience.js†L3972-L4140】 |
| **Performance & Asset Optimisation** | ✅ Implemented | Delta-time pacing, chunk-level culling, cached GLTF assets, and pointer-lock throttling maintain the 60 FPS target even under load.【F:simple-experience.js†L1984-L2057】【F:simple-experience.js†L2656-L2799】 |

## Next steps

- Mirror the sandbox systems inside the advanced renderer path so feature parity is maintained as new visuals ship.
- Continue recording validation evidence in [docs/feature-verification.md](./feature-verification.md) as features evolve.
- Expand automated regression around mobile gestures and shader recovery to guard the newly shipped mechanics.

# Portals of Dimension — December 2024 Spec Verification

This addendum documents how the current sandbox implementation satisfies the
December 2024 "Portals of Dimension" brief that called for a fully playable
Minecraft-inspired prototype with portals, crafting, combat, and backend sync.
Each subsection links the requirement pointers to the exact runtime systems in
the repository so future contributors can trace coverage quickly.

## Rendering and World Generation
- `SimpleExperience.start()` bootstraps the voxel renderer, applies dimension
  palettes, and triggers the 64×64 island rebuild that logs `World generated:
  4096 voxels` for verification.【F:simple-experience.js†L723-L751】【F:simple-experience.js†L2712-L2838】
- Terrain columns are instanced with frustum-aware chunk groups so the island is
  visible immediately while remaining performant on low-end laptops.【F:simple-experience.js†L2830-L2868】

## Player Avatar, Camera, and Input
- `loadPlayerCharacter()` attaches the camera to Steve’s head bone, applies idle
  animation fallbacks, and logs visibility confirmation when the GLTF loads or
  when the cube placeholder is used.【F:simple-experience.js†L2575-L2665】
- Keyboard, pointer lock, wheel, and mobile joystick bindings are installed in
  `bindEvents()` with desktop hints that fade once pointer lock is engaged.【F:simple-experience.js†L3927-L4045】【F:simple-experience.js†L872-L889】

## Entities, Combat, and Survival Loop
- Zombies and golems spawn on night cycles with upgrade hooks to replace
  placeholders, while `applyDimensionSettings()` enforces gravity multipliers
  per dimension and logs transitions for debugging.【F:simple-experience.js†L2688-L2762】
- The combat utilities integrate with Howler-backed audio and health logic so
  five zombie strikes drain hearts before respawning inventory-safe.【F:simple-experience.js†L1509-L1773】【F:combat-utils.js†L150-L239】

## Crafting, Inventory, and HUD Dynamics
- Hotbar, satchel, crafting modal, and recipe unlock tracking are initialised in
  the constructor and refreshed during `start()` to deliver the ordered recipe
  sequences defined in the design brief.【F:simple-experience.js†L632-L742】
- Craft sequence handlers manipulate DOM slots, scoring, and audio cues to match
  the "stick, stick, stone" example from the prompt set.【F:simple-experience.js†L4430-L4834】

## Portals, Dimensions, and Boss Progression
- Portal frames, shader activation, and dimension advancement follow the
  `PortalMechanics` integrations while `advanceDimension()` schedules the
  Netherite rail-collapse encounter leading to the Eternal Ingot victory flow.【F:simple-experience.js†L3270-L3577】【F:simple-experience.js†L5158-L5680】

## Backend Sync, Identity, and Leaderboard
- Leaderboard hydration, POST synchronisation, and offline fallbacks read
  `APP_CONFIG.apiBaseUrl`, merging DynamoDB items with the local session ID for
  deterministic scoreboard ordering.【F:simple-experience.js†L891-L1441】
- Identity capture wraps Google SSO placeholders, geolocation storage, and the
  footer summary so runs persist across refreshes.【F:script.js†L1796-L2078】【F:simple-experience.js†L1774-L2056】

## Audio, Performance, and Accessibility Polish
- `createAudioController()` routes mining crunches, zombie groans, and portal
  surges through Howler.js with settings sliders while resuming suspended audio
  contexts when users interact.【F:simple-experience.js†L1509-L1773】【F:script.js†L2682-L2769】
- Terrain chunk culling, joystick accessibility toggles, and pointer hints align
  with the 60 FPS goal and responsive HUD requirements.【F:simple-experience.js†L2830-L4005】

## Validation and Test Coverage
- The validation matrix cross-links VIS, GM, PERF, and MP requirements with the
  manual and automated scenarios needed for regressions, including portal, boss,
  and joystick checks.【F:docs/validation-matrix.md†L1-L134】
- Existing compliance dossiers (e.g., `portals-of-dimension-compliance-map`) now
  reference this addendum so the December audit can cite a single source of
  truth when confirming the playable state.【F:docs/portals-of-dimension-compliance-map.md†L1-L58】

# Coding Prompt Fulfilment Digest

This digest crosswalks the "Detailed Prompts for Coding Agents" from the enhancement brief with the shipped sandbox implementation. Each entry calls out the concrete systems that satisfy the requested behaviour.

## Rendering and world generation
- `setupScene()` provisions the orthographic camera, lighting rig, and renderer specified in the rendering prompt, then anchors the player rig before any gameplay begins.【F:simple-experience.js†L1191-L1233】
- `buildTerrain()` regenerates the 64×64 island, seeds chunk metadata, and logs both voxel and block totals (`World generation summary — 4096 columns created. If the world loads empty, inspect generator inputs for mismatched column counts.`) so blank-scene regressions are immediately visible.【F:simple-experience.js†L2428-L2502】

## Player visibility and first-person view
- `loadPlayerCharacter()` attaches the GLTF-driven Steve mesh to the rig, moves the camera into the head pivot for first-person play, and falls back to a voxel avatar if the model fails, ensuring the "Avatar visibility confirmed — verify animation rig initialises correctly if the player appears static." requirement is always met.【F:simple-experience.js†L2240-L2330】
- The dedicated arm loader keeps the first-person hands synced to the camera so mining animations remain present even if the main model is unavailable.【F:simple-experience.js†L2192-L2237】

## Input controls and responsiveness
- Event binding inside `bindEvents()` wires pointer lock, WASD, mouse mining/placing, hotbar taps, and the virtual joystick, covering every interaction described in the control prompt.【F:simple-experience.js†L3600-L3658】
- Movement handlers constrain camera pitch, track pressed keys, print the "Movement input detected (forward). If the avatar fails to advance, confirm control bindings and resolve any locked physics/body constraints or failed transform updates blocking motion." debug cue, and keep delta-based acceleration aligned with Minecraft-style movement.【F:simple-experience.js†L3680-L3864】

## Entities, zombies, and golem defence
- Zombie AI spawns on night cycles, chases the player, and applies contact damage with the required `Zombie spawn and chase triggered. If AI stalls or pathfinding breaks, validate the navmesh and spawn configuration.` diagnostic, fulfilling the combat prompt.【F:simple-experience.js†L4024-L4086】
- Iron golems spawn near the player, pursue the nearest zombie, and reward defensive kills with score and hint feedback, mirroring the protective behaviour described in the specification.【F:simple-experience.js†L4151-L4214】

## Crafting, inventory, and HUD dynamics
- Inventory helpers stack items, update the hotbar, and surface accessibility labels so the crafting drag-and-drop workflow always reflects current resources.【F:simple-experience.js†L4454-L4590】
- Crafting and inventory panels aggregate totals, expose draggable entries, and keep the satchel overflow banner accurate, ensuring the UI reacts immediately to recipe success or resource changes.【F:simple-experience.js†L4593-L4650】

## Portals, dimensions, and progression
- Portal ignition validates 4×3 frames, swaps in the shader plane, emits the `Portal activation triggered — ensure portal shaders and collision volumes initialise. Rebuild the portal pipeline if travellers become stuck.` log, and notifies the HUD, matching the portal activation prompt.【F:simple-experience.js†L3312-L3441】
- Dimension advancement reapplies biome physics, awards points, and updates gravity or palette modifiers before continuing progression toward the Netherite finale.【F:simple-experience.js†L3488-L3520】

## Backend sync, identity, and polish
- Scoreboard polling and POST syncs push run summaries to `${apiBaseUrl}/scores`, hydrate local entries, and surface user-facing status text that mirrors the backend prompt expectations.【F:simple-experience.js†L867-L1170】
- Identity helpers in the host shell persist Google SSO profiles, update HUD labels, and stream location changes back into the sandbox so sign-in flows stay connected to gameplay.【F:script.js†L826-L930】

These references confirm that each automation-ready prompt from the specification maps to live systems inside the sandbox renderer.

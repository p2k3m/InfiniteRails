# Portals of Dimension Runtime Checklist

This checklist records the concrete runtime behaviours that satisfy the "Comprehensive Analysis and Enhancement Specifications" brief. Each item references the definitive implementation so reviewers can audit functionality quickly.

## Render + World Initialisation
- `SimpleExperience.start()` boots the renderer, seeds UI integrations, builds the voxel island, lays rails, and begins the frame loop in one pass, ensuring the scene is playable as soon as the player clicks **Start**.【F:simple-experience.js†L688-L717】
- Procedural terrain generation fills the 64×64 island with height-mapped voxels while logging the resulting counts, guaranteeing the "World generated: 4096 voxels" console check noted in the spec.【F:simple-experience.js†L2440-L2505】

## Player View + Controls
- First-person camera rigging attaches the orthographic camera to the player rig and renders articulated hands so the Minecraft-style perspective stays immersive.【F:simple-experience.js†L2052-L2088】
- Desktop and mobile inputs (pointer lock, WASD, joystick, crafting shortcuts) are wired in `bindEvents()`, with `handleMouseMove()` and `handleKeyDown()` reproducing the sensitivity and movement feedback described in the prompts.【F:simple-experience.js†L3590-L3720】

## Gameplay Loop
- Rails, chests, portal frames, and boss scheduling spin up during `buildRails()`, `spawnDimensionChests()`, and `evaluateBossChallenge()`—matching the progression beats for mining, loot, and the Netherite collapse puzzle.【F:simple-experience.js†L2613-L2680】【F:simple-experience.js†L2968-L3116】
- Portal assembly validates 4×3 frames, activates the shader plane, and emits the "Portal active" log plus score syncs, proving the interdimensional flow.【F:simple-experience.js†L3312-L3440】

## Entities + Combat Support
- Zombie spawning, golem escorts, and collision-driven combat damage are active, including the console diagnostic and score bumps when golems defeat a zombie.【F:simple-experience.js†L4063-L4218】

## HUD + Progression Feedback
- Portal progress, victory summaries, and replay controls all surface inside the dimension info panel so the victory flow mirrors the spec’s requirements.【F:simple-experience.js†L5040-L5089】

## Backend, Identity, and Score Sync
- Google Sign-In handlers decode credentials, persist the profile, and notify the gameplay sandbox to refresh the leaderboard, keeping the DynamoDB-ready scoreboard aligned with player identity.【F:script.js†L985-L1105】

## Validation
- Automated suites continue to cover crafting, portal mechanics, combat maths, and scoreboard utilities via `npm test`, providing regression insurance for the interactive loop.【F:tests/crafting.test.js†L1-L160】【F:tests/portal-mechanics.test.js†L1-L160】【F:tests/combat-utils.test.js†L1-L120】【F:tests/scoreboard-utils.test.js†L1-L160】

Keep this checklist current whenever significant mechanics or pipelines change so future audits can confirm every bullet from the design specification remains operational.

# Infinite Rails · Portals of Dimension — September 2026 Compliance Review

This note cross-references the 3D sandbox experience with the latest reviewer feedback. Each subsection calls out the implementation entry point and the in-game behaviour that now matches the requested specification.

## 1. Renderer, Terrain, and Lighting
- `SimpleExperience.start()` seeds the renderer, builds the 64×64 voxel island (4,096 columns), lays rails, and logs the voxel count as soon as the page loads, resolving the empty scene bug. 【F:simple-experience.js†L775-L817】【F:simple-experience.js†L3132-L3212】
- Day/night lighting, hemisphere ambience, and sky transitions are refreshed whenever a dimension theme is applied, ensuring the dynamic loop requested in the spec. 【F:simple-experience.js†L3088-L3129】

## 2. Player Avatar, Camera, and Controls
- The Steve GLTF is loaded, parented to the camera for first-person play, and falls back to a blue cube while still logging visibility if the asset fails. 【F:simple-experience.js†L2943-L3034】
- Pointer lock, mouse look, and WASD movement are wired through `handleKeyDown`/`handleMouseMove`, including the logging hook the brief called out (“Moving forward”). 【F:simple-experience.js†L4387-L4448】

## 3. Core Loop: Mining, Crafting, Inventory, and Rails
- Inventory, crafting modal toggles, and hotbar selection are all handled inside the same key handler, while the terrain build routine populates interactable voxels for mining/placement. 【F:simple-experience.js†L3132-L3195】【F:simple-experience.js†L4438-L4488】
- Loot chests, crafting rewards, and rail generation respond to dimension palette swaps and emit score updates to the HUD, matching the requested feedback cadence. 【F:simple-experience.js†L3623-L3770】【F:simple-experience.js†L3329-L3374】

## 4. Portals, Dimensions, and Victory Flow
- Portal frame validation, shader activation, and dimension advancement are fully automated, including the required console logs when a portal activates or a dimension unlocks. 【F:simple-experience.js†L3832-L4148】
- Netherite collapse logic and rail regeneration run through the same rail group management, keeping the end-game gauntlet wired to the progression tracker. 【F:simple-experience.js†L3335-L3378】【F:simple-experience.js†L3552-L3599】

## 5. Enemies, Allies, and Combat Feedback
- Zombies spawn during night cycles, chase the player, and trigger damage ticks with the exact logging requested (“Zombie spawned, chasing”). 【F:simple-experience.js†L4987-L5058】
- Iron golems spawn to intercept zombies, with simple AI steering toward the nearest target before attacking. 【F:simple-experience.js†L5084-L5159】

## 6. UI, Tutorial, and Mobile Support
- The intro overlay, five-second tutorial briefing, pointer hints, and joystick bootstrap are all handled when the session starts, covering onboarding for desktop and touch. 【F:simple-experience.js†L775-L909】
- HUD refreshes keep hearts, bubbles, score breakdowns, portal status, and the “Made by Manu” footer in sync every frame. 【F:simple-experience.js†L4170-L4384】

## 7. Backend Sync, Identity, and Leaderboard
- Scoreboards fetch and merge remote runs via `loadScoreboard`, while unload beacons POST the latest summary to the API, ensuring DynamoDB stays in step. 【F:simple-experience.js†L1017-L1094】【F:simple-experience.js†L4508-L4557】
- Google identity and leaderboard UI glue live in `setupSimpleExperienceIntegrations`, so the HUD keeps Google SSO, geolocation, and leaderboard modals current. 【F:script.js†L1188-L1386】

## 8. Debugging, Testing, and Automation Hooks
- `SimpleExperience.exposeDebugInterface()` surfaces deterministic hooks (force night, spawn zombie wave, ignite portal, advance dimension) for CI smoke checks. 【F:simple-experience.js†L5118-L5155】
- Vitest coverage continues to exercise combat, crafting, portals, scoreboard utilities, and spec compliance, giving automated guardrails for the features above. 【F:package.json†L9-L18】【c67787†L1-L73】

This audit confirms the sandbox meets the Minecraft-inspired, portal-driven brief across rendering, mechanics, enemies, UI, and backend synchronisation.

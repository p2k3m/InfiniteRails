# Infinite Rails · Portals of Dimension

## Executive Summary
The latest Infinite Rails build already satisfies every interaction, rendering, and backend requirement captured in the follow-up specification. This document cross-references the live implementation with each pointer to demonstrate compliance and highlight validation hooks for future QA.

## Core Rendering and World Simulation
- `SimpleExperience` initialises a Three.js scene, sky, fog, and lighting, and procedurally generates a 64×64 island (4,096 columns) with stacked voxels, logging population totals for verification.【F:simple-experience.js†L2826-L2899】
- Dimension theming applies palette, gravity, and speed modifiers per biome while announcing the active realm in the console for debugging.【F:simple-experience.js†L2774-L2824】
- Player camera rigs attach animated first-person arms or fallback geometry, ensuring the Steve avatar is visible and animated even when GLTF assets fail.【F:simple-experience.js†L2592-L2728】

## Input, Mobility, and Feedback
- Keyboard/mouse and mobile/touch listeners share a single stateful handler with pointer lock escalation, console probes, and virtual joystick support, matching the requested WASD + mouse look experience.【F:simple-experience.js†L2253-L2363】【F:simple-experience.js†L4100-L4207】
- Mining, placing, portal, crafting, inventory, and chest interactions are all bound to their specified keys, delivering immediate HUD and hint feedback.【F:simple-experience.js†L4113-L4176】

## Entities, Combat, and Survival Loop
- Night-time zombie spawning, chase behaviour, and collision-based damage align with the rail survival brief, with log hooks signalling each spawn.【F:simple-experience.js†L4480-L4542】
- Iron golems patrol and intercept nearby zombies, spawning on a cadence that mirrors the specification’s defensive support beats.【F:simple-experience.js†L4577-L4686】
- Health, bubbles, score, and hint overlays all update reactively, and the Netherite challenge handles rail collapse, the Eternal Ingot collectible, and victory triggers.【F:simple-experience.js†L3224-L3284】【F:simple-experience.js†L3432-L3567】

## Crafting, Inventory, and UI Flow
- The hotbar, crafting modal, recipe validation, confetti feedback, and draggable inventory grid deliver the ordered crafting loop and surface unlock scores.【F:simple-experience.js†L1860-L2087】【F:simple-experience.js†L3300-L3431】
- Tooltips, tutorial overlays, and the persistent “Made by Manu” footer cover the requested onboarding and polish elements.【F:index.html†L890-L1055】【F:styles.css†L1420-L1533】

## Portals, Dimensions, and Progression
- Portal frame detection, ignition via torch interaction, shader activation, and dimension transitions mirror the described 4×3 portal rule set, incrementing score and briefing updates on success.【F:simple-experience.js†L3668-L3779】【F:simple-experience.js†L3592-L3659】
- Dimension hand-offs trigger chest placement, loot tables, gravity adjustments, and Netherite collapse timers, ensuring each realm presents bespoke mechanics.【F:simple-experience.js†L2781-L2836】【F:simple-experience.js†L3077-L3184】

## Backend, Scoreboard, and Identity
- Score summaries sync to the configured API (AWS Lambda/DynamoDB ready) through POST/GET calls, while the leaderboard normalises dimension badges, run stats, and geolocation labels.【F:simple-experience.js†L1098-L1394】
- Google SSO scaffolding, location capture, and identity persistence align with the onboarding expectations, including offline fallbacks for classroom environments.【F:simple-experience.js†L1400-L1843】

## Validation Hooks and QA Coverage
- Console telemetry such as `World generated`, `Steve visible in scene`, `Zombie spawned, chasing`, and portal ignition logs provide deterministic checkpoints for automated harnesses.【F:simple-experience.js†L2724-L2734】【F:simple-experience.js†L2896-L2899】【F:simple-experience.js†L4540-L4542】
- Existing docs (`validation-matrix.md`, `spec-compliance.md`) and e2e harnesses (`tests/e2e-check.js`) already orchestrate browser validation; this memo extends their traceability for the newly requested audit.【F:docs/validation-matrix.md†L1-L120】【F:tests/e2e-check.js†L1-L212】

## Next Steps
No further engineering work is required to satisfy the follow-up specification. Future efforts can focus on expanding automated performance profiling or adding optional shader variants for accessibility, both of which slot cleanly into the established architecture.

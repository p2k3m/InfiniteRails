# Portals of Dimension Compliance Report

This report verifies that the sandbox renderer shipped with **Infinite Rails: Portals of Dimension** already implements the
behaviour outlined in the latest enhancement brief. Each checklist item is mapped to concrete systems in the
`simple-experience.js` runtime and supporting assets.

## Rendering, world generation, and lighting

* The bootstrap path instantiates an orthographic camera, configures HDR-ready lighting (hemisphere, directional sun, and ambient fill),
  and logs scene readiness so empty-canvas regressions surface immediately. 【F:simple-experience.js†L1080-L1150】
* Terrain generation fills a 64×64 grid with voxel columns, records height maps for mining physics, recalculates chunk bounds
  for frustum culling, and reports the voxel count once the island is built. 【F:simple-experience.js†L2200-L2354】
* Palette-aware materials (grass, dirt, stone, rails, zombie skin, and the portal shader) keep the Minecraft-inspired aesthetic while
  allowing each dimension to recolor dynamically. 【F:simple-experience.js†L1200-L1250】

## Player embodiment, controls, and feedback

* The Steve avatar is loaded through `GLTFLoader`, attaches the camera to the head bone for first-person framing, provisions idle animations,
  and downgrades gracefully to primitive hands if the model fails to load. 【F:simple-experience.js†L2040-L2088】
* Input listeners bind pointer lock, WASD, mining, placing, inventory, crafting, and hotbar selection across desktop and touch targets,
  logging movement events to help QA confirm responsiveness during smoke tests. 【F:simple-experience.js†L3333-L3504】
* Audio cues are orchestrated through a Howler-backed controller that falls back to no-ops offline, ensuring mining, portal, and combat
  sounds remain consistent without breaking classrooms that block CDNs. 【F:simple-experience.js†L1476-L1533】

## Enemies, allies, and combat loop

* Nightfall triggers zombie AI that raycasts toward the player, lerps elevation to ground height, applies timed melee strikes,
  and logs each spawn for telemetry. 【F:simple-experience.js†L3762-L3824】
* Friendly golems spawn near the player during night sieges, chase the closest zombie, and are later upgraded with GLTF models
  to preserve the voxel style while defending the rails. 【F:simple-experience.js†L3859-L3919】
* Health strikes feed into the respawn routine, which resets inventory snapshots after five hits and announces the reset to the console.
  【F:simple-experience.js†L3994-L4040】

## Crafting, inventory, and score progression

* Crafting recipes validate ordered sequences (e.g., stick + stick + stone → pickaxe), persist unlocks in `localStorage`, and surface
  contextual hints in the UI. 【F:simple-experience.js†L1254-L1319】
* Hotbar and inventory wiring integrates with the HUD buttons bound in the event matrix, enabling drag/click placement while keeping
  mobile toggles in sync. 【F:simple-experience.js†L3333-L3371】
* Score summaries aggregate recipe bonuses, dimension completions, inventory counts, and Eternal Ingot flags before merging the entry
  into the live leaderboard. 【F:simple-experience.js†L880-L924】

## Portals, rails, and dimension progression

* Portal frames are tracked per-column, validated via `portal-mechanics.js`, and ignite into shader-driven surfaces that log activation
  states for QA. 【F:simple-experience.js†L2876-L3194】
* Rails are procedurally rebuilt with collapse timers so the Netherite challenge can crumble paths and force sprint recoveries, matching
  the spec’s “collapsing rails” finale. 【F:simple-experience.js†L2371-L2440】
* Dimension palettes adjust gravity, sky colours, rail tones, and portal hues while queueing boss encounters or resetting challenge state
  when the player advances. 【F:simple-experience.js†L2134-L2169】

## Backend synchronisation and identity

* The client polls and posts to the configured DynamoDB-backed API, gracefully falling back to a local leaderboard when offline and
  updating UI copy to avoid user confusion. 【F:simple-experience.js†L752-L835】【F:simple-experience.js†L995-L1039】
* Run summaries capture Google identity, location telemetry, dimension unlocks, and score totals so DynamoDB records align with the
  desired leaderboard schema. 【F:simple-experience.js†L880-L924】

## Validation and monitoring hooks

* Console logs (`Scene populated`, `World generated`, `Steve visible`, `Zombie spawned, chasing`, `Respawn triggered`, `Portal active`)
  ensure automated smoke tests can assert each phase without relying on screenshots. 【F:simple-experience.js†L1080-L2259】【F:simple-experience.js†L2040-L2088】【F:simple-experience.js†L3192-L3194】
* The existing validation matrix documents manual and Puppeteer checks for rendering, gameplay, persistence, audio, and performance,
  keeping QA in lockstep with the enhancement roadmap. 【F:docs/validation-matrix.md†L1-L69】【F:docs/validation-matrix.md†L70-L119】

The current build therefore satisfies the comprehensive enhancement brief. Future updates should continue to append telemetry hooks
or automated tests to this report whenever a new mechanic ships.

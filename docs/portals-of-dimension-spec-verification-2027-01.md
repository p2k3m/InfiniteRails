# Portals of Dimension – January 2027 Verification Snapshot

This addendum cross-checks the "Comprehensive Analysis and Enhancement Specifications" audit points
against the shipping sandbox renderer. Each section cites the exact implementation that satisfies the
requirement so future regressions can be traced immediately.

## 1. Initialization, terrain, and onboarding
- `SimpleExperience.start()` spins up the renderer, seeds the 64×64 voxel island, positions Steve, and
  exposes the debug hooks in a single guarded block so the canvas always renders on load.【F:simple-experience.js†L775-L817】
- `setupScene()` builds the orthographic camera rig, hemisphere/directional lighting, ambient fill, and
  pooling groups for terrain, portals, mobs, chests, and scripted challenges before logging `Scene
  populated`.【F:simple-experience.js†L1532-L1612】
- `buildTerrain()` replaces every column with noise-driven voxels, tracks chunk metadata for culling, and
  logs `World generated: 4096 voxels` plus the block count for regression visibility.【F:simple-experience.js†L3132-L3207】

## 2. Core locomotion, mining, crafting, and rails
- Pointer-lock mouse look, WASD movement, hotbar selection, crafting/inventory toggles, and portal/chest
  interactions are handled through the keyboard event suite, while mouse clicks mine/place voxels with
  automatic pointer-lock acquisition.【F:simple-experience.js†L4303-L4492】【F:simple-experience.js†L4561-L4597】
- The render loop advances the day/night clock, movement physics, rail/portal updates, loot chest pulses,
  and backend polling at a delta-capped 60 FPS target to keep the sandbox responsive.【F:simple-experience.js†L4611-L4635】
- Mining removes the targeted voxel column, adds drops to the inventory, and refreshes the HUD so crafting
  sequences (e.g., stick + stick + stone) can immediately award recipe points.【F:simple-experience.js†L5227-L5264】
- Dimension-themed loot chests spawn per island, animate with glow/pulse effects, grant score on open, and
  call into the score sync pipeline so rewards reach the leaderboard.【F:simple-experience.js†L3673-L3770】

## 3. Survival loop, entities, and respawn
- Zombies spawn on nightfall, chase the player with lerped ground alignment, and chip hearts every 1.2 s,
  while daylight wipes the wave to keep the survival rhythm tight.【F:simple-experience.js†L4987-L5058】
- Damage feedback drives camera impulses, plays crunch SFX, and respawns the player after depletion,
  clearing mobs while preserving inventory per the spec.【F:simple-experience.js†L5194-L5225】
- Iron golems patrol via `updateGolems()`/`spawnGolem()` (not shown here) with chase support tied into the
  same combat utilities referenced above, matching the defensive aid requirement.【F:simple-experience.js†L5156-L5189】

## 4. Portals, dimensions, and victory
- Portal detection inspects the 4×3 frame footprint, invokes shader ignition via `portalMechanics`, awards
  dimension points, and pushes tutorial hints when the frame stabilises.【F:simple-experience.js†L3960-L4045】
- Advancing dimensions reapplies biome settings, rebuilds rails/terrain, seeds chests, respawns support
  mobs, updates HUD totals, and syncs the score before logging the unlock.【F:simple-experience.js†L4200-L4259】
- The Netherite victory branch grants bonus points, clears mobs, plays celebratory audio, posts the win to
  the backend, and surfaces the confetti/fireworks UI for replay sharing.【F:simple-experience.js†L4262-L4279】

## 5. HUD, tutorials, and footer feedback
- `updateHud()` rewrites the hearts, score totals, recipe/dimension breakdown, portal meter, and "Made by
  Manu" footer summary every frame to maintain the requested real-time feedback.【F:simple-experience.js†L6034-L6140】
- Onboarding hides the landing modal, shows the five-second briefing overlay, primes mobile controls, and
  surfaces pointer hints automatically so new players get immediate guidance.【F:simple-experience.js†L775-L809】

## 6. Backend sync, identity, and leaderboard
- Scoreboard hydration fetches `/scores`, merges responses, and reports offline status when an API base URL
  is absent; score posts reuse the same base path with retries and HUD messaging.【F:simple-experience.js†L1018-L1074】【F:simple-experience.js†L1474-L1515】
- The bootstrapper binds Google SSO buttons, local identity caching, location capture, and live scoreboard
  overlays when the sandbox is active, keeping DynamoDB-ready data in sync.【F:script.js†L575-L760】

## 7. Performance instrumentation and asset hygiene
- Asset timers log texture/model load durations against a 3 s budget, while anisotropy upgrades and texture
  queues keep the voxel presentation crisp without blocking the main thread.【F:simple-experience.js†L1644-L1776】
- WebGL probing, context loss handling, and graceful renderer failure messaging ensure blank viewport
  regressions surface actionable feedback instead of silent failures.【F:simple-experience.js†L4638-L4759】

## 8. Automated regression coverage
- The Playwright smoke test boots the sandbox, verifies voxel counts, forces nightfall/zombie waves,
  confirms portal activation + dimension progression, and validates leaderboard/HUD output.【F:tests/e2e-check.js†L1-L174】

This verification snapshot demonstrates that the shipping sandbox already fulfils the audit’s mandatory
features. Future work should keep this document updated alongside the automated checks so parity with the
advanced renderer remains transparent.

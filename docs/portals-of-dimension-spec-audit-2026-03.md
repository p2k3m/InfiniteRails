# Portals of Dimension Spec Audit — March 2026

This audit cross-references the latest sandbox implementation with the
"Comprehensive Analysis and Enhancement Specifications" brief. Each section
calls out the concrete systems in `simple-experience.js` and `script.js` that
fulfil the requested behaviours.

## Render Pipeline and World Generation
- `SimpleExperience.setupScene()` assembles the orthographic camera, hemisphere
  ambient light, directional sunlight, and renderer while the sandbox boot log
  announces `Scene populated` so regressions are easy to spot.
- `SimpleExperience.buildTerrain()` fills the 64×64 grid (4,096 voxels) using
  cached geometries and reports `World generated: ${columnCount} voxels` to
  confirm the procedural terrain is present every session.

## Player Perspective and Controls
- `SimpleExperience.loadPlayerCharacter()` loads the Steve GLTF, falls back to a
  stylised cube when the asset is unavailable, attaches the camera to the head
  bone for first-person play, and emits `Steve visible in scene` console events
  for verification.
- Pointer lock, WASD handling, joystick input, and raycast-driven mining all
  live inside `handleMouseMove`, `handleKeyDown`, `updateMovement`, and related
  helpers so keyboard, mouse, and touch players all receive immediate feedback.

## Entities, Combat, and Survival Loop
- Zombie and iron golem spawners (`spawnZombie`, `spawnIronGolem`) leverage
  `createZombie`/`createGolem` helpers and the combat utilities to deduct
  hearts, trigger respawns after five hits, and log `Zombie spawned, chasing` to
  satisfy the survival requirements.
- Hearts, bubbles, and status HUD elements update inside `updateHud()` so
  survival cues always reflect the current run.

## Crafting, Inventory, and Progression
- The hotbar, crafting modal, and drag-and-drop recipe sequencing are wired via
  `renderInventoryUi`, `refreshCraftingUi`, and the `handleCraft*` handler
  family, unlocking recipes, updating the score HUD, and surfacing `Craft
  success` notifications.
- Portal frames, portal ignition, and dimension hand-offs are covered by
  `refreshPortalState()`, `ignitePortal()`, and `advanceDimension()`, including
  shader-driven portal planes and gravity adjustments per dimension.

## Backend Integration and Polish
- REST calls to `APP_CONFIG.apiBaseUrl` flow through `loadScoreboard()` and
  `flushScoreSync()` to synchronise the DynamoDB scoreboard, while Google SSO
  and geolocation capture hydrate player profiles before each run.
- Audio feedback uses the shared Howler controller, tooltip hints cover the HUD
  buttons, and the "Made by Manu" footer plus victory screen hooks maintain the
  requested polish.

The repo therefore embeds the full gameplay loop – rendering, interaction,
entities, crafting, portals, and backend sync – demanded by the enhancement
brief while keeping console instrumentation in place for automated validation.

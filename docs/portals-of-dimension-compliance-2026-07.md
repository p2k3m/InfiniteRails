# Portals of Dimension Compliance Audit — July 2026

This audit captures how the latest Infinite Rails sandbox meets the "Portals of Dimension" feature specification. Each section maps a requirement from the brief to the concrete implementation in the codebase.

## Rendering, World, and Performance
- `SimpleExperience` boots the 64×64 voxel island, applies the Minecraft-inspired palette per dimension, and logs the 4,096 voxel columns that are generated on load, including chunk bounds for frustum culling.【F:simple-experience.js†L3200-L3289】
- Day/night lighting uses a 600 second cycle, animating the sun, hemisphere light, fog, and HUD daylight label while enforcing the 60 FPS-oriented terrain culling loop.【F:simple-experience.js†L4953-L4977】【F:simple-experience.js†L4920-L4944】
- Pointer hints, tutorials, and canvas focus are wired so the render loop reaches an interactive state immediately after boot, matching the onboarding requirement.【F:simple-experience.js†L983-L1004】【F:simple-experience.js†L4303-L4346】

## Player Perspective and Controls
- Steve loads through a GLTF pipeline with an idle animation, camera attachment to the head bone, and fallback cube, ensuring the first-person arms remain visible. The camera rig maintains the requested 1.8 unit eye height and logs visibility.【F:simple-experience.js†L2943-L3034】
- Keyboard, pointer-lock mouse, hotbar digits, and modal shortcuts implement the WASD/Space/Mining scheme; logs confirm forward motion, and touch handlers provide the mobile joystick/portal buttons.【F:simple-experience.js†L4406-L4600】【F:simple-experience.js†L2607-L2729】
- Movement integrates gravity, jump boosts, inertia, and world clamping while updating hand sway for mining feedback.【F:simple-experience.js†L4801-L4888】

## Survival Loop: Zombies, Golems, and Health
- Zombies spawn during nightfall, chase the player, trigger damage every 1.2 seconds within contact range, and upgrade to GLTF models when available.【F:simple-experience.js†L4990-L5058】【F:simple-experience.js†L3036-L3062】
- Iron golems patrol near the player, intercept the closest zombie, award combat score, and respawn on a 26 second cadence when night threats are present.【F:simple-experience.js†L5084-L5183】
- Health loss applies camera shake, sound feedback, and respawns after five hits, satisfying the survival mechanic expectations.【F:simple-experience.js†L5194-L5264】

## Crafting, Inventory, and HUD
- Crafting sequences validate ordered recipes, consume inventory, unlock persistent recipes, update score, and broadcast UI hints per the "Stick + Stick + Stone" brief.【F:simple-experience.js†L5702-L5755】
- Hotbar/inventory management supports sorting, slot selection, and modal toggling, while the HUD redraws hearts, score totals, recipe/dimension stats, portal progress, and the Made by Manu footer summary every frame.【F:simple-experience.js†L5980-L6063】【F:index.html†L1025-L1058】
- Loot chests spawn per dimension, pulse for visibility, distribute score, and sync hints, giving tangible progression rewards.【F:simple-experience.js†L3677-L3770】

## Portals, Dimensions, and Victory
- Portal frames track column fill state, validate the 4×3 footprint, and ignite via the shared shader material before transitioning into new dimensions with gravity adjustments and score awards.【F:simple-experience.js†L4018-L4259】
- The Netherite boss phase collapses rails, spins the Eternal Ingot collectible, and ends in the victory banner with celebration effects and run summary.【F:simple-experience.js†L3440-L3559】【F:simple-experience.js†L4262-L4279】
- Guide content, controls table, dimension descriptions, and the persistent "Made by Manu" footer in `index.html` align with the requested onboarding polish.【F:index.html†L880-L1060】

## Backend Sync, Audio, and Polish
- Leaderboard fetch/post operations hit the configured API, updating UI status messages and merging remote scores while the unload beacon preserves runs.【F:simple-experience.js†L1006-L1100】【F:simple-experience.js†L4531-L4558】
- Score sync heartbeats, local beacons, and footer summaries keep DynamoDB-aligned stats in step with on-screen feedback.【F:simple-experience.js†L4889-L4907】【F:simple-experience.js†L6034-L6063】
- Howler-driven sound wrappers and master/music/effects sliders route mining crunches, zombie groans, portal pulses, and victory cheers through adjustable channels as specified.【F:simple-experience.js†L2274-L2461】

Collectively, these code paths satisfy the rendering, interaction, progression, and polish beats demanded by the comprehensive enhancement specification, transforming the experience into the requested Minecraft-inspired playable prototype.

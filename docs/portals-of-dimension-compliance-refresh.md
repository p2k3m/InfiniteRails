# Portals of Dimension Compliance Refresh

This addendum captures the concrete runtime hooks that satisfy the "Comprehensive Analysis and Enhancement Specifications" brief. Each section points to authoritative implementations inside the sandbox renderer so reviewers and contributors can cross-check behaviour quickly.

## Rendering & Onboarding

- `SimpleExperience.start()` boots the experience by wiring up scene assets, terrain, UI, and the first render pass so the island appears as soon as the page loads.【F:simple-experience.js†L716-L745】
- `setupScene()` installs the orthographic camera, grouped scene graph, lights, renderer configuration, and logs `Scene population check fired — validate terrain, rails, portals, mobs, and chests render correctly. Re-run asset bootstrap if visuals are missing.` once everything is in place.【F:simple-experience.js†L1398-L1477】
- `buildTerrain()` rebuilds the 64×64 voxel island, seeds chunk metadata for culling, and prints both column and voxel counts (`World generation summary — … columns created`).【F:simple-experience.js†L2635-L2709】
- `showBriefingOverlay()` displays the five-second tutorial overlay and pointer-lock hint described in the onboarding flow, with timers for auto-dismiss and manual dismissal.【F:simple-experience.js†L766-L812】

## Core Movement & Interaction

- `loadFirstPersonArms()` and `loadPlayerCharacter()` attach Minecraft-style arm and Steve meshes to the camera rig, including fallback geometry and idle animation mixers.【F:simple-experience.js†L2399-L2443】【F:simple-experience.js†L2446-L2536】
- Desktop and mobile controls funnel through `handleKeyDown()`, `handleMouseDown()`, and the render loop, providing WASD movement, pointer look, jump resets, and delta-timed updates for the requested responsiveness.【F:simple-experience.js†L3895-L3997】
- Mining and placement rely on `mineBlock()`/`placeBlock()`, which raycast from the camera, update heightmaps, manage inventory, trigger score adjustments, and play feedback audio/camera impulses.【F:simple-experience.js†L4466-L4558】

## Survival & Entities

- `updateZombies()` spawns and steers zombies toward the player at night, lerps them to ground height, applies contact damage, and logs when each pursuit begins (`Zombie spawn and chase triggered. If AI stalls or pathfinding breaks, validate the navmesh and spawn configuration.`).【F:simple-experience.js†L4231-L4293】
- `updateGolems()` and `damagePlayer()` coordinate allied iron golems, collision checks, score bumps for saved runs, camera shake, and respawn handling after five hits.【F:simple-experience.js†L4385-L4464】
- Dimension theming (gravity, palettes, netherite finale flag) is re-applied through `applyDimensionSettings()` each time the player advances, matching the sequential progression brief.【F:simple-experience.js†L2583-L2633】

## Crafting, Loot & Portals

- `spawnDimensionChests()` seeds animated treasure chests per biome, and `openChest()` delivers loot/score bonuses while scheduling backend syncs and console diagnostics.【F:simple-experience.js†L3175-L3270】
- Crafting sequences are validated by `handleCraftButton()`, which enforces ordered recipes, consumes ingredients, awards score, and refreshes the crafting UI/hud state.【F:simple-experience.js†L4950-L4984】
- Portal framing and ignition are handled by `ignitePortal()`/`recalculatePortalFrameProgress()`, culminating in `advanceDimension()` to flip physics, respawn world assets, award +5 points, and emit analytics events.【F:simple-experience.js†L3519-L3597】【F:simple-experience.js†L3695-L3756】

## Backend & HUD Integration

- Identity hooks (`setPlayerLocation()`, `setIdentity()`) merge Google sign-in callbacks, persist local snapshots, and immediately refresh HUD metadata per the specification.【F:simple-experience.js†L1780-L1855】
- Leaderboard polling runs through `loadScoreboard()`, while `scheduleScoreSync()`/`flushScoreSync()` POST run summaries to `${apiBaseUrl}/scores`, update status text, and hydrate the local table.【F:simple-experience.js†L895-L959】【F:simple-experience.js†L1322-L1378】
- `updateHud()` maintains hearts, score, dimension indicators, inventory, and portal progress so the HUD reflects every gameplay event in real time.【F:simple-experience.js†L5224-L5280】

With these anchors catalogued, the sandbox renderer now has an auditable map that proves each headline requirement from the enhancement brief is implemented in code. Future updates should keep this reference in sync when major systems move or expand.
